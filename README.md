Head to the [download](http://github.com/thebigbad/mft3k/downloads) page and install the xpi.

For Developers
============

After cloning, do as they say in the [good book](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Setting_up_extension_development_environment#Firefox_extension_proxy_file), navigate to:

    ~/.mozilla/firefox/$PROFILE_NAME/extensions

...and create a file named:

    mft3k@borderstylo.com

Inside that file, write the path of this project (making sure it ends in slash).
